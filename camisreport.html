							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>
								For my Summer 2020 work term I was hired by Camis as a software configuration specialist. 
								I had the opportunity to work remotely in this position due to COVID-19 restrictions.

							<h2>About the Employer</h2>

								software they create is almost exclusively used for camping and other outdoor activities. There are many different teams at Camis that 
								are responsible for different tasks such as development, quality assurance, and product delivery. All these teams work together to produce 
								the current product 'Camis 5' which is a combination of an on-site and web software system for creating activity reservations.
